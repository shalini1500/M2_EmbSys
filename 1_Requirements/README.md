# Air Pollution Monitoring System
# Introduction-
The growing air and sound pollution is one of the serious issues these days. 
This large amount of increasing pollution has made human life prone to large number of diseases.
* The main objectives of  project are The growing air and sound pollution is one of the serious issues these days,To display the readings in the led  and in LCD,If threshold value gets exceeded, the led  will give confirmation.
#   Working  
* Switching on the power supply, all the components become active.

* Gas sensor and sound sensor start to monitor continuously.

* If the air pollution level is exceeded beyond threshold value, the led will be one and display the air measurement in lcd.
* The readings will be displayed on LCD .
# components
* Gas Sensor(MQ135)
*  Nodemcu (ESP-8266)
 
* Aurdino Nano 
 
* LCD Display(16 X 2)
 
* LED

* Transistor
## SWOT Analysis
* Strengths
    * Analysis of air quality of various gases is done accurately.
* Weakness
    * Gas sensor is sensitive for gases like alcohol,ch4 etc.,
    
* Opportunity 
   * sensing the air quality and taking appropriate action.
* Threats
   * Due to sensitivity of gas sensor there may  be breakage.
## 4 W's and 1 H
 # Who
  * Industries and household workers to keep check the air quality and take appropriate action.
  # What
     * sensing air quality in atmosphere and display in lcd.
  # When
  * Industries releasing gases through chimney or it useful to anywhere to check the air quality.
  # Where
      * Industries.
      * To estimate the pollution.  
      * Indoor Air Quality Monitoring.  

# How
 * Sensing a particular gas using mq135 gas sensor and the values will be displaying in lcd by this we can reduce air pollution.

## HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENT
|Test ID  |    Description  |  
-------------|-----------------------------------
|HL01     |    Sense the enivronment | 
|HL02     |    Immediate response of monitoring air quality         |
|HL03     |    Hiher response time    |
|HL04     |    environment must to able to detect the air qualty  |
|HL05     |    The projector must be able to store information or data |
## Low Level Requirement
|Test ID   |  Description | 
------------------|-------------------
|LL01     | The projector should have low power consumption |
|LL02   | The projector must not get overheated |
