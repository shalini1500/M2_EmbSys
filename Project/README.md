# Air Pollution Monitoring System
# Introduction-
The growing air and sound pollution is one of the serious issues these days. 
This large amount of increasing pollution has made human life prone to large number of diseases.
* The main objectives of  project are The growing air and sound pollution is one of the serious issues these days,To display the readings in the led  and in LCD,If threshold value gets exceeded, the led  will give confirmation.
#   Working  
* Switching on the power supply, all the components become active.

* Gas sensor and sound sensor start to monitor continuously.

* If the air pollution level is exceeded beyond threshold value, the led will be one and display the air measurement in lcd.
* The readings will be displayed on LCD .
# components
* Gas Sensor(MQ135)
*  Nodemcu (ESP-8266)
 
* Aurdino Nano 
 
* LCD Display(16 X 2)
 
* LED

* Transistor
## HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENT
|Test ID  |    Description  |  
-------------|-----------------------------------
|HL01     |    Sense the enivronment | 
|HL02     |    Immediate response of monitoring air quality         |
|HL03     |    Hiher response time    |
|HL04     |    environment must to able to detect the air qualty  |
|HL05     |    The projector must be able to store information or data |
## Low Level Requirement
|Test ID   |  Description | 
------------------|-------------------
|LL01     | The projector should have low power consumption |
|LL02   | The projector must not get overheated |
## SWOT Analysis
* Strengths
    * Monitors air quality in atmosphere.
    
* Weakness
    * Sensitive to some gases like ethane,ozone.
* Opportunity 
   * Tracking and determine the air quality.
* Threats
   * Due to sensitivity the gas sensor may  explode.
## 4 W's and 1 H
 # Who
  * Industries.
  # What
     * Monitors air quality.
  # When
  * If thershold level is exceeded then the corresponding action will be like led on and message  in lcd display . 
  # Where
      * In city roads traffic noise.
      * Activities like shooting, open air events, football and cricket matches.
  
  


# Applications 
* To estimate the pollution.  
* Indoor Air Quality Monitoring.
* To design server and upload data on that server with date and time.
*  We can use it at industrial area as there is lot of noise pollution
*  In city roads traffic noise.
*  Activities like shooting, open air events, football and cricket matches.
*  At small level, in schools and colleges we can use this device.
*   Automation Automation.
