 # Aim
  * Air pollution affects our day to day activities and quality of life. It poses a threat to the ecosystem and the quality of life on the planet.
  *  The dire need to monitor air quality is very glaring, owing to increased industrial activities over the past years. People need to know the extent to which their activities affect air quality. 
  *  This project proposes an air pollution monitoring system. 
  *  The system was developed using the Arduino microcontroller. 
  *  The air pollution monitoring system was designed to monitor and analyze air quality in real-time and log data to a remote server, keeping the data updated over the internet. 
  *   The air quality measurements taken by the designed system was accurate. 
# Input 
 *  The model was designed using an 
       *  Arduino Uno microcontroller
       *   Wi-Fi module 8266
       *    MQ135 Gas Sensor 
       *    16 by 2 liquid crystal display (LCD) Screen.
