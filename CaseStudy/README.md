# Air and Sound Pollution System
# Introduction-
The growing air and sound pollution is one of the serious issues these days. 
This large amount of increasing pollution has made human life prone to large number of diseases.
* The main objectives of  project are The growing air and sound pollution is one of the serious issues these days,To display the readings in the mobile application and in LCD,If threshold value gets exceeded, the buzzer will give confirmation by beep sound and also we will receive notification in the mobile. 
#   Working  
* Switching on the power supply, all the components become active.

* Gas sensor and sound sensor start to monitor continuously.

* If the air pollution level is exceeded beyond threshold value, the buzzer starts to give alarm and also we will receive a notification in the mobile saying “air pollution detected” through the blynk app.

* It goes same for the sound sensor also by giving notification “sound pollution increasing take care” and “noise pollution detected’ in the mobile.

* The readings will be displayed on LCD and also in the mobile.

# Applications 
* By using this project, we can monitor the readings of air and sound pollution levels in a particular area and we can take measures accordingly when the value exceeds.This IOT based air and noise pollution monitoring system project is a great step towards a healthy livelihood. With the help of this project not only the municipal authorities but even the common people can participate in the process of controlling pollution and ensure safe environment.
