# Air Pollution Monitoring System
# Introduction-
The growing air and sound pollution is one of the serious issues these days. 
This large amount of increasing pollution has made human life prone to large number of diseases.
* The main objectives of  project are The growing air and sound pollution is one of the serious issues these days,To display the readings in the led  and in LCD,If threshold value gets exceeded, the led  will give confirmation.
#   Working  
* Switching on the power supply, all the components become active.

* Gas sensor and sound sensor start to monitor continuously.

* If the air pollution level is exceeded beyond threshold value, the led will be one and display the air measurement in lcd.
* The readings will be displayed on LCD .
# components
* Gas Sensor(MQ135)
*  Nodemcu (ESP-8266)
 
* Aurdino Nano 
 
* LCD Display(16 X 2)
 
* LED

* Transistor
